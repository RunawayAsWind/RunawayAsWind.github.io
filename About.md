**About me:**
<div style="max-width: 50%; padding: 0 10px; box-sizing: border-box; word-wrap: break-word;">
My journey as a game developer began at UESTC and led me to the engine team at Tencent. 
<br>
<br>
Beyond coding, I'm driven by a passion for anime and illustration. In-game, I thrive in competitive PvP, where my prowess lies in consistently securing key eliminations.
