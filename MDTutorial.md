# Multi-line Breaks
You can use &lt;br&gt; for multiple line breaks
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Line Breaks
This is the first line. If you only press enter once and then write this line.
Then when rendered, these two lines will be tightly together, looking like the same paragraph.

But if you add a blank line between two sentences like this.

Then they will become two separate paragraphs with noticeable spacing.
